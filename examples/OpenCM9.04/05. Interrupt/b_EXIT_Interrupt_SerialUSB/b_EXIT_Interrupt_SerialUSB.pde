 EXIT_Interrupt_LED

 Cicuit : 
   Toggle Button must be conneted Pin 5 with pull-down 3.3V
   ID 1 dynamixel is connected to TTL or RS485, anything is good.

 This example demonstrate how to use EXIT Interrupt with Dynamixel.
 If button is pushed, dynamixel connected moves to position 0. 
 If pushed again, it moves to position 500 repeatedly with LED blinking
